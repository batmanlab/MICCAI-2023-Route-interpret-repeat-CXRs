This paper proposes a novel iterative interpretable method that identifies instance-specific concepts without losing the performance of the BB and is effectively fine-tuned in an unseen target domain with no concept annotation, limited labeled data, and minimal computation cost. Also, as in the prior work, MoIE-captured concepts may not showcase a causal effect that can be explored in the future.
